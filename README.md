# Person List

This exam will test your basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation using PHP. The HTML templates are already built. Only the PHP code to wire them is required. Take note of the little details in the HTML as there are clues on how to implement the code.

## Requirements
1. PHP Code to implement functionality
2. Input validations
3. User feedback loop - user must be able to know if a process succeeded or not.
4. When you are done, compress your files in ZIP format and send it to info@pragmanila.com along with your CV and application letter.

## Pointers:
- Clearly written code is a big plus
- MVC and OOP is a huge advantage
- You can modify the design as long as the flow stays the same
- You can use any available framework that you are familiar with

GLHF!

## How to run
- Create a database `person_list`
- Import the `schema.sql` located at `module/profile/schema.sql`
- Set your database credentials to `config/services.php`
- If you're php7 run `php -S localhost:8888 -t public` on the your root folder
- And Olah!
